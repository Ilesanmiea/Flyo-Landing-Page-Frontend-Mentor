## Overview
This is a link to my [Frontend Mentor ](https://www.frontendmentor.io/profile/Ilesanmiea) to checkout my other projects. 
I spent time to use this challlenge to develop my core **tech stacks** like **HTML _&_ CSS**  which I found very interesting.

### The challenge
This challenge has helped and improve the my CSS powess but the interesting thing I was able to do is to use the CSS function: `width: calc(98vw + 10px) ` which was  the first time I would be exxperimenting that on my project. I felt happy and fulfilled.

### Users should be able to: ###

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

### Screenshot

I am sorry because I am unable to provide the pages views for different screen-sizes for this project because It be difficult as the time of **commiting this project**.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS3
- Flexbox
- Responsive Design
- No libaries

### What I learned

- One Special thing added to my skillsets on CSS3 is my ability to use the `calc` function though I have learrnt it over time but I have never used it on a practiacl project like this. I thank God for this project to help me express the full usage.

**Code Snippets**
`width:calc`

### Continued development

One another major challenge I want to work on is the curvy background image which gave me a tough time making responsive at all screen devices which still overlows on some screen sizes.

### Useful resources

I went online on Frontend mentor to review other developers' codes to help me fix mine on this challenge.
